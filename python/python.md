1. What are Dunder Methods?
In Python, dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) are special methods that begin and end with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.
These methods are not meant to be called directly by you in most cases. Instead, Python internally calls them when certain operations are performed.
