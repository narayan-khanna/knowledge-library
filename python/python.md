# Python Fundamentals

**Dunder methods** (short for *double underscore methods*) are **special methods** in Python.  
They always **begin and end** with double underscores, such as:

- `__init__`
- `__str__`
- `__len__`

---

## Key Points
- These methods are **not meant to be called directly** in most cases.
- Python **internally calls them** when certain operations are performed.
- They help in customizing the **behavior of objects**.
