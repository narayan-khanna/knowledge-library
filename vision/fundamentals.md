- An image is an n-dimensional function
- F(X,Y), where X and Y are spatial coordinates (system that describe the positions of objects in a physical space)
- Function F(X,Y) is characterized by two components: the amount of illumination from the source and the amount of illumination reflected by the object in the scene
- In 3D images - F(X,Y,Z) - tripletxi,yi,zi is called a voxel (volume element)
- Image channels are simply the different color components that make an image.
- images represented commonly by matrices
- An image is a static representation at a single point in time, while a video is a sequence of images played at a rate that creates an illusion of motion. This rate is what we can call frames per second.
